Assignment 1: Portfolio <br>
Summary of Delivery:<be>
We decided to build the portfolio for group member Sami Hassan. We took the employment, education, and skills content from his resume and put it on different pages of our portfolio. We put an introduction on the main page (index.html), which included his education details and other things about himself. The portfolio consists of 4 other pages: Skills, Employment, Projects, and Contact info. We added a stock profile picture to our portfolio instead of using his actual face.<br>
